# CSDatingApp
This is a C# WPF Dating Application. The features include: weighted elo system, superlikes, like, dislike, automatic population of profiles.


The goal of this one-day project was to kill my spaghetti code habits and enhance my OOP. Also this is a first-time with WPF, it is unresponsive and locked to one window size.

The Profile class contains private setters and public getters for the functionality of the program. There is also an AdminProfile subclass that contains an adminSetElo method which should be protected unless you create an AdminProfile object.
